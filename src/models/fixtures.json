{"_id":"7neMwM5kxt8WxJJYp","content":"##### Pokemon as Global Phenomenon inside the World of Pokemon, a Global Phenomenon\n\n*The following is a response to [\"Fear Not, Pokemon Will Save the Planet\"](https://killscreen.com/articles/fear-not-pokemon-will-save-planet/) by Adam Kranz, published 7/12/16 on Kill Screen. To begin, a few caveats:*\n\n* *I am, at best, a fair-weather Pokemon fan. I know there are significant differences between the anime, manga, and games, and will try to accommodate them as best able.*\n* *It's also been a while since I've delved into some of the theory I obliquely reference, so please forgive any unintentional elisions.*\n* *Finally, \"speculative fiction\" here refers to the relatively recent (the past century) trend of fictive works functioning as allegorical commentary.*\n\n\u003e\"Pokemon’s world-building is opportunistic… …even when doing so undermines the coherence of the culture and ecology of Kanto, Johto, and their successors.\"\n\nOn this, we agree unequivocally. \n\nDespite overtones of environmental harmony and pastoral virtuousness through depictions of environmental reconciliation, the world of Pokemon plays fast and loose with notions of ecology, coexistence, and society. Though these illustrations are almost universally positive, they fail to constitute a positive environmental ethic in either their world or our own. \n\nUndoubtedly, the world of Pokemon is a beautiful one. Human settlements exist inside vast expanses of pristine landscape with few perceptible externalities. The creatures themselves are a cornerstone of the culture, omnipresent in media, sport, material goods, and daily life. Furthermore, the consensual relationships between Pokemon and their human counterparts are mutually beneficial and rewarding in almost every sense. In this, the fiction is remarkably effective in integrating distinctly human activities and their manifestations as part of the natural world. \n\nAnd yet, the inconsistencies are many. While all fictive texts have their arbitrary rules, Pokemon takes close care to deny fundamental systems: food production, reproduction, predation, and regional/global effects are all utterly ignored. This is Pokemon's fundamental structural failing.\n\nBy denying the prevalence, complexity, and necessity of systems, Pokemon celebrates a platonic Nature rather than a holistic Environment. And although this succeeds in rejecting Romantic constructions of wilderness and nature, humanity still operates from a privileged position—a position which is re-iterated constantly in the text. Pokemon are anthropomorphised, with emotional lives reflective of our own; Pokemon perform labour and construction, but almost explicitly in service of human intent; the various [\"artificial\" Pokemon](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Artificial_Pokémon) developed through genetic manipulation or other man-made means. It may be the \"Pokemon\" world, but the 'mon just live in it.\n\nIn this light, it is easy to recast the world of Pokemon in a  pleasantly dystopic light. Devastated by ecosystem collapse, reconciliatory practices mitigate negative externalities while fauna has been supplanted by a limited and increasingly-abstract class of purpose-built creatures. These creatures exist either as domestic companions and labourers or as tightly-managed stocks in nature preserves for sport and tourism. Human society, beholden to this arrangement, spirals deeper into a particular hyperreality of mutualism and harmony, where smiling, Poke-faced ecological interventionism is championed as the sole means of progress.\n\nAs such, it becomes easier to understand the flimsy reactionary and terrorist movements within the fiction. Rather than blaming the authors wholesale for the clumsy application of various radical environmental ideologies, they simply do not work inside this universe. They rely on cultural and symbolic references that exist only in our realm, not that of the Pokemon, and seem utterly absurd as such. What is biodiversity when the entirety of animal life consists of a flat catalogue of loosely-affiliated monsters? How does one call for systemic environmental responsibility when the locus of anthro-environmental interaction is quasi-professionalised  Pokemon training?\n\nIt is this fundamental disconnect—the dizzying complexity of life systems on Earth and all the signifiers we use to understand it versus those of the rigorously policed Pokedex definitions—that prevents the world of Pokemon from developing a meaningful ethic or critique toward the environment. One needs only to look at how Pokemon Go has mapped onto our world to understand the complexities and dynamics the fiction of Pokemon is simply incapable of reconciling. Our politics of space, fetishisation of rarity, and sudden, mass social action simply have no analogue and no conceptual accommodation in these media.\n\nAnd perhaps that is what Pokemon is best understood as: a cultural phenomenon, both real and imagined. In their world, the Pokemon undergird economic activity and humans' ambiguous sentimentality toward nature—a Potemkin environmentalism that rings hollow. In our world, its success as a brand and business sublimates whatever original well-meant ethic Pokemon contained in an effort to maintain interest and popularity around the globe, always becoming ever-more abstract.\n\nThis [Pokemon is a sword](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Honedge_(Pokémon)), for heaven's sake.\n\n---\n\nThis isn't to say Pokemon is uniquely hobbled by these deficiencies. Environmentalism-as-branding is widespread, with product green-washing and incomprehensible appeals to outdoorsy sentiment commonplace. *Avatar* and its feel-good tale of environmental preservation was predicated on Unobtainium mining. *Unobtainium*. The fresh, organic bananas at the supermarket were flown in by a gas-guzzling freight plane. *The Lorax* featured Danny DeVito as a plaintive voice of reason. Madness, are these not?\n\nInstead, I think all ecological fiction suffers from this structural defect. Where space operas and high fantasy can manage MacGuffins with ease, ecological storytelling is fundamentally concerned with naturally-occurring systems, their complexity, and their function. The burden of proof for the suspension of disbelief is raised sufficiently high that earnestly ecological texts have two options: \n\n* Embrace inaccessibility in the spirit of \"hard\" fiction and attempt to communicate all the complexities therein.\n* Develop compellingly abstract allegory that risks losing the nuance and referents of Earth's own ecology.\n\nBut if the fiction fails to encourage reflexive thought or political action, is there really a choice?\n\n---\n\nAs a rather cynical sort of person, I recognise that a popular environmental ethics devoid of anthropocentrism is an unlikely thing. We live in the Anthropocene, after all. Similarly, a studiously interrogative fiction of Pokemon that encourages something beyond than \"lets be friends with animals\" will probably never be. And I'll concede that utopian fiction is a tremendous motive for hope and change. But it never hurts to tug at the edges.\n\n*Related ideas that didn't make the cut:*\n\n* *How do systems in Pokemon run across or against the fiction (e.g. cities as encounter-free safe spaces)?*\n* *How has the narrative treatment of Pokemon and the environment has evolved over time and market value (e.g. Pikachu transitioning from vermin to mascot)?*","published":{"$date":"2016-07-15T21:39:59.632Z"},"slug":"pokemon-and-environmental-ethics","title":"Pikachu Shops at Whole Foods","type":"blog"}

I've been using my Fitbit for more than a year—Strava, Nike+, and Garmin Connect much longer—but never really given data extraction much more thought than their baked-in dashboards. Now, I'm interested. \n\nAnd has that ever been a can of worms.\n\nAs soon as I started looking around the Fitbit API docs, I knew things were going downhill: casual mentions of Premium membership, daily totals, etc. Given that I've been somewhat-slavishly examinig my step counts sunce last year, I knew there was better data available—but how to get it? Luckily, some kind soul (ok, [corynissen](https://github.com/corynissen/fitbitScraper)) put together a scraper for the Fitbit dash. Even if the data isn't reliable or meaningful, it's always a comfort to see other folks doing the same mad things as I am.\n\nThat said, it's becoming absurd how complicated access to one's own fitness data is becoming. This doesn't necessarily strike me as being the same as proper medical and health records, but that seems like an awfully good model to aspire to—or even to exceed. Individual data storage and delivery is so insanely straightforward that options ought to exist at marginal cost. But, I digress.\n\nHaving resolved the conundrum of extraction, I'm merely tasked with interpretation and visualization. I know the perspective afforded by short-term trends has always been helpful, and I had hoped a bit of [Feltron-esque](http://feltron.com) analysis would prompt some more changes on my part. But honestly, I'm not even sure I'll find something worth sharing—this was my not-very-cunning way of forcing a choice between charting/visualisation libraries.\n\nWait, I did what now?","published":{"$date":"2015-07-07T04:45:32.516Z"},"slug":"fitness-data-kicking-and-screaming","title":"Fitness Data: Kicking \u0026 Screaming","type":"blog"}
{"_id":"dEwtmkzr6iu3mZx5B","content":"Been reading a bit lately. From [*The Real World of Technology (Revised Edition)*](http://amzn.to/1f4N7A2) by Ursula M. Franklin. From pages 31–32:\n\u003e The scientific method works best in circumstances in which the system studied can be truly isolated from its general context. This is why its first triumphs came in the study of astronomy.  \n\n\u003e On the other hand, the application of the general to the specific has been much less successful in situations where generalisation was achieved only by omitting essential considerations of context. These questions of reductionism, of loss of context, and of cultural biases are cited quite frequently by critics of the scientific method. We hear much less about the human and social effects of the separation of knowledge from experience that is inherent in any scientific approach. These effects are quite wide-spread and I think they can be serious and debilitating from a human point of view.  \n\n\u003e Today scientific constructs have become *the* model of describing reality rather than *one* of the ways of describing life around us. As a consequence there has been a very marked decrease in the reliance of people on their own experience and their own senses. The human sense of sight and sound, of smell and sound and taste and touch, are superb instruments. All senses, including the so aptly named \"common sense,\" are perfectible and it's a great pity that we have so little trust in them. For instance, people know at what point an ongoing noise will give them a headache, but all too often they feel the need for an expert with a device that measures the noise in decibels. The expert then has to compare the noise level measured with a chart that indicates the effect of noise levels on the nervous system. Only when that chart and the expert say, \"Yes, indeed, the noise level is above the scientifically established tolerance range,\" do people believe that it was indeed the noise and not a figment of their imagination that gave them persistent headaches. I'm not talking here about an either-or situation in which either personal experience or an established measuring procedure is paramount; what I am talking about is the downgrading and the discounting of personal experience by ordinary people who are perfectly well equipped to interpret what their senses tell them. I dwell on this because the downgrading of experience and the glorification of expertise is a very significant feature of the world of technology. Sometimes it is important to stress that because the scientific method separates knowledges from experience it may be necessary in case of discrepancies to question the scientific results or the expert opinion rather than to question and discount the experience. It should be the experience that leads to a modification of knowledge, rather than abstract knowledge forcing people to perceive their experience as being unreal or wrong.","published":{"$date":"2015-08-11T04:36:05.829Z"},"slug":"expertise","title":"Expertise","type":"blog"}

Writer\u0026#8217;s block has always been a bit of a thing with me, but even more so when writing expressly for myself. I rebuilt this site in the Spring of 2014, with the full intention of blogging—I\u0026#8217;d noodled with Tumblr and other platforms for writing, but could never get over the underlying sense of \u0026#8220;\u003cem\u003eeuch\u003c/em\u003e.\u0026#8221; I wanted to own my work.

So he decided to make something \u003cem\u003efun\u003c/em\u003e to learn with, to fool around with; to write an \u0026#8220;app with an audience of one\u0026#8221;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd all of the sudden it all seemed to click into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8212;\nWhich is really just a long way of telling how I ended up building this site. It\u0026#8217;s a Meteor app running on a virtual private server. Why Meteor?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Meteor Development Group seems to be doing a bang-up job, and there\u0026#8217;s an active development community (even here in Cincinnati).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe prospect of one language everywhere—even if it\u0026#8217;s JavaScript—is awfully tempting given that an awful lot of my work ends up written in JS. I have a handle on the basics; I want to get better.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s modular. Meteor encompasses a mess of smaller, interconnected projects that can be swapped out and extended as necessary.

Various work and personal projects have been a snap to slap together with Meteor, and although I\u0026#8217;m starting to feel some of the rough edges, I don\u0026#8217;t plan on changing anytime soon. As I mentioned above, I\u0026#8217;m not fond of others owning my writing or work; so if this site has any sort of mission, it is to remedy that. Once I have something more tangible than a nebulose notion I\u0026#8217;ll be writing about all that here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHaving said that, the site is far from perfect. As is the case with virtually every JavaScript front-end framework, things like accessibility, performance, and progressive enhancement are non-entities. I\u0026#8217;d like for that to change—either with Meteor or without it. And, I\u0026#8217;ll be honest. There\u0026#8217;s plenty else that needs polish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8212;\nSo, why do all this? Because I forgot I am my most important audience.

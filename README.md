# Daisy

A blog that posts to and reads from other places. It's written in Node.js and uses MongoDB. 

## In Progress

Daisy is still pretty much non-functional, but things in progress:

* Solidifying schema definitions (whether all posts should live in one collection, or separate collections)
* Auth/admin for post creation and admin

## To Do

* Add Twitter posting
* Add Tumblr posting
